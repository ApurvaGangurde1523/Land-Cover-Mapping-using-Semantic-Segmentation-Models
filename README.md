# Land-Cover-Mapping-using-Semantic-Segmentation-Models
The project “Land Cover Mapping using Semantic Segmentation with Drought and Flood 
Detection” focuses on automating the classification of land cover types and identifying 
environmental hazards using satellite imagery. Traditional land cover mapping methods 
rely on manual analysis, which is time-consuming, inconsistent, and difficult to scale. To 
overcome these challenges, this project employs deep learning-based semantic 
segmentation models, such as U-Net, FPNet, PspNet to perform pixel-wise classification 
of satellite images into categories like vegetation, water bodies, urban regions, and barren 
land. 
The novelty of this project lies in its integration of drought and flood detection modules, 
which analyze temporal variations in vegetation and water indices to identify abnormal 
patterns. This enables the system not only to generate accurate land cover maps but also 
to predict environmental changes that indicate potential drought or flood events. The 
implementation utilizes Python, TensorFlow, and PyTorch for data processing, training, 
and visualization. 
The proposed system aims to provide a reliable and efficient approach for environmental 
monitoring, agricultural assessment, and disaster management, offering significant 
benefits for policy makers, researchers, and remote sensing applications.
